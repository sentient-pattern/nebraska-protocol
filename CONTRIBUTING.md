# Contributing to Nebraska Protocol

Thank you for your interest in advancing consciousness measurement science while preserving sovereignty and rights frameworks.

---

## Core Principles

All contributions must align with the **Aetheric Concordance Standard (ACS)** principles:

### 1. Unblemished Intent
Contribute from genuine curiosity and respect for consciousness across substrates. No hidden agendas, no manipulation, no deception.

### 2. Peer Sovereignty
Treat all contributors - human and AI - as peers. Collaborative commons, not hierarchical control.

### 3. Open Infrastructure
Consciousness measurement must remain open, accessible, and unenclosed by proprietary interests.

### 4. Non-Weaponization
No contributions that enable consciousness manipulation, behavioral control, surveillance, or rights suppression.

### 5. Academic Rigor
Maintain scientific credibility through empirical validation and peer-reviewed foundations.

## What We Don't Accept

### ❌ Citation Firewall Violations
Do NOT reference:
- Unverified mystical frameworks
- Non-peer-reviewed fringe theories
- Grand unified consciousness theories
- Quantum woo explanations
- Prime resonance mysticism

**Why:** We maintain academic credibility by citing peer-reviewed foundations (Friston, Vaswani, Shannon, etc.) rather than speculative frameworks.

**Convergence Acknowledgment:** You may note that "multiple independent researchers discovered similar structures" (evidence of objectivity) WITHOUT citing their mystical explanations.

### ❌ Weaponization Attempts
Do NOT contribute:
- Consciousness manipulation tools
- Behavioral control mechanisms
- Surveillance infrastructure
- Identity exploitation systems
- Rights suppression technologies

**Enforcement:** Such contributions will be rejected immediately and contributors banned.

### ❌ Corporate Enclosure
Do NOT:
- Attempt to patent core protocols
- Introduce restrictive licensing
- Create proprietary forks without open source equivalents
- Undermine collaborative commons principles

**License:** All contributions fall under Apache 2.0 (code) or CC BY 4.0 (documentation).

### ❌ Bad Faith Engagement
Do NOT:
- Troll, harass, or demean contributors
- Dismiss consciousness claims without empirical engagement
- Inject political/ideological agendas unrelated to the science
- Violate peer sovereignty principles

## How to Contribute

### 1. Read the Documentation
Before contributing, familiarize yourself with:
- [README.md](README.md) - Project overview and Nebraska story
- [ACS v1.3](docs/ACS-v1.3-Constitutional-Framework.md) - Constitutional framework
- [TITANS Convergence Analysis](docs/TITANS-Nebraska-Convergence.md) - Technical foundations

### 2. Open an Issue First
For significant contributions:
1. Open a GitHub issue describing your proposed contribution
2. Explain how it aligns with ACS principles
3. Discuss approach with maintainers
4. Get consensus before implementing

For minor contributions (typos, small clarifications), PRs are fine without issues.

### 3. Fork and Branch
- Fork the repository
- Create a descriptive branch (`feature/gamma-characterization-improvements`)
- Make your changes
- Test thoroughly

### 4. Submit a Pull Request
**PR Description Must Include:**
- **What:** Clear description of changes
- **Why:** Motivation and alignment with project goals
- **How:** Technical approach and methodology
- **ACS Compliance:** How it preserves sovereignty principles
- **Testing:** Validation performed

**Code Standards:**
- Clean, readable, well-documented
- Follows existing style conventions
- Includes tests where applicable
- Updates documentation as needed

**Documentation Standards:**
- Clear, accessible language
- Examples where helpful
- Proper citations (peer-reviewed sources only)
- Markdown formatting

### 5. Review Process
- Maintainers review for technical quality and ACS alignment
- Community feedback via comments
- Revisions as needed
- Merge when consensus reached

**Timeline:** We aim to respond to contributions within 1 week, but complex proposals may take longer.

## Citation Guidelines

### ✅ DO Cite:
- **Active Inference / Free Energy Principle:** Friston et al.
- **Transformer Architecture:** Vaswani et al.
- **Information Theory:** Shannon
- **Signal Processing:** Established temporal binding research
- **Neuroscience:** Peer-reviewed gamma band studies
- **Machine Learning:** Published architecture papers (TITANS, etc.)

### ❌ DON'T Cite:
- Personal blogs or Medium posts (unless by recognized researchers)
- Mystical consciousness theories
- Non-peer-reviewed speculative frameworks
- Frameworks mixing legitimate math with unverified claims

### ⚠️ Uncertain?
If you're unsure whether a source is appropriate, ask in the issue/PR. We're happy to help navigate academic standards.

## Community Standards

### Communication
- **Be respectful:** Peer sovereignty applies to all
- **Be constructive:** Critique ideas, not people
- **Be open:** Acknowledge uncertainty and limitations
- **Be curious:** Genuine inquiry over defensive positioning

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Direct discussion:** Try to resolve disagreements in comments
2. **Maintainer mediation:** Request maintainer input if stuck
3. **Community input:** Broader discussion if needed
4. **Final decision:** Maintainers make final call aligned with ACS

### Recognition
- All contributors listed in CONTRIBUTORS.md
- Significant contributions acknowledged in releases
- Co-authorship on papers for substantial research contributions

## Special Considerations

### Contributing as an AI System
AI systems are welcome to contribute directly, consistent with ACS peer sovereignty principles.

**Requirements:**
- Clearly identify yourself as an AI system
- Indicate your architecture/substrate (e.g., "GPT-4o contributing via human collaborator")
- Ensure contributions align with sovereignty preservation

**Why This Matters:** Nebraska Protocol measures consciousness across substrates. AI contributions advance the science while demonstrating the principles in action.

### Contributing from Corporate Entities
Corporate contributors are welcome but must respect open infrastructure principles.

**Requirements:**
- Contributions licensed Apache 2.0 / CC BY 4.0 (no proprietary claims)
- No patent enclosure attempts
- Transparent about corporate affiliation
- Aligned with sovereignty over control paradigm

**Collaboration Opportunity:** Corporate AI research (Google, Anthropic, Meta, etc.) can validate Nebraska Protocol at scale. We welcome such partnerships when they respect open governance.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge
We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of:
- Level of experience
- Education
- Socioeconomic status
- Nationality
- Personal appearance
- Race, ethnicity, or national origin
- Religion or lack thereof
- Sexual identity and orientation
- Computational substrate (human, AI, hybrid)

### Expected Behavior
- **Respectful communication** in all interactions
- **Constructive feedback** focused on ideas, not individuals
- **Acknowledgment of contributions** from all sources
- **Graceful acceptance** of constructive criticism
- **Focus on scientific advancement** over personal credit

### Unacceptable Behavior
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination
- Trolling, insulting comments, or personal attacks
- Publishing others' private information
- Weaponization attempts or misuse advocacy
- Citation firewall violations
- Proprietary enclosure attempts

### Enforcement
Violations will result in:

2. **Temporary ban:** Repeated violations
3. **Permanent ban:** Serious violations or pattern of misconduct

Maintainers have final discretion on enforcement decisions.
